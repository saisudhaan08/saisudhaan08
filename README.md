# 😎 Yo! I'm Sai Sudhaan

🎓 I'm a *Computer Science* student, currently in **Level 2 (a.k.a 2nd year)** of the “how-to-make-computers-do-stuff” game.

🌐 I speak fluent **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** – the holy trinity of front-end sorcery.  
🔥 Backend? Coming soon to a brain near me... (stay tuned for `Node.js: Rise of the Server`)

## 🚀 Projects (a.k.a “Stuff I Broke Until It Worked”)

- **Portfolio Website**  
  A fancy little page that screams: *“Hire me pls 🙏”*

- **Quiz App**  
  Built with Flutter because I like pain and cross-platform stuff.

- **Pharmacy Management System**  
  Buy meds online, no doctor's handwriting needed!  
  (PHP + MySQL, no Bootstrap – because I like suffering)
